On the eighth day the guest revealed himself as Odin and cursed the king.

Having learned this, the king rose quickly, but the sword which he had lain upon his knee slipped and fell and he was impaled upon it.
 
Odin vanished."

Thou wouldst thy wisdom make known:
What name has the field where in fight shall meet
Surt and the gracious gods?'

Surt and the gracious gods;

You do not dare touch it."
skald_dream_11,"You see Níðhǫggr, the serpent.

You had imagined the Malice Striker as a child and the memory shrinks in comparison to the massive body and trail corpses crashing into the dirt beneath it."

The world beneath your head shakes, but you find the source of neither the gnashing nor the trembling."

It has become a cultural capital of the world.

You awake with pride."

She carefully plucks a chip of wood from the ground and presents it to you.

Jēra ᛃ"

Somewhere, a great howl rings out and your hair stands on end."

Surtr stands before you, gesturing to for you to approach.

His body shatters into countless fragments."

You wake wondering if the nightmare was real."

Amber mead flows and laughter is shared as the guests celebrate your victory.

Algiz ᛉ"
skald_dream_elder_01,"A dream comes to you of you and your companions in the Black Forest. 

The wilderness grows dark around you. You call out but your voice is swallowed by the shadow. 

You turn. An immense hand covers you in vines and everything becomes silent…"
skald_dream_elder_02,"You dream you are felling trees for an upcoming feast. 

You bring your axe down.
It catches in the bark and is pulled from your grasp. 

You look up and see the face of the Black Forest itself…"

The stench of the composted earth,
a bitter taste of fear.
The gift of a companion's mirth,
the forest driven clear."

As you reach the peak, the ground stirs below you and a single ice-blue eye stares up…"
skald_dream_yagluth_01,"You dream you are visiting the palace of a great king. Lavish foods and gilded furniture are carefully laid out. Servants and delegates come and go with matters of import. 

You enter the throne room and the king gestures for you. As you near, his visage turns to bone and a hand grips your throat…"
skald_dream_defeated_all_01,"A hundred hands of regents past place a crown on your head.

A chorus of cheers rings out in celebration."
